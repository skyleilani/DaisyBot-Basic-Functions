# DaisyBot Fundamental Functions 

This project is part of Dr. Carlotta Berry's Robotics for the Streets initiative, aimed at making robotics more accessible to a wider audience. The goal of this project is to provide a basic setup for controlling the movement of a DaisyBot robot, using a simple circuit with two Dagu DG01D motors, an Arduino Mega, and a TB6612 driver IC on a breadboard.

This project is intended to demonstrate basic functionality only, without any sensors or additional features.

## Hardware Components
2 x Dagu DG01D motors
1 x Arduino Mega
1 x TB6612 Driver IC on a breakout board
1 x Breadboard

## Software Components
Arduino IDE

## Installation and Running
To install and run the code, follow these steps:

1. Install Arduino IDE.
2. Set the board type to Arduino Mega under Tools -> Boards.
3. Set the port to COM4 under Tools -> Port.
4. Connect the hardware components according to the wiring diagram below.
5. Open the set_motor_direction_and_speed.ino file in Arduino IDE and upload it to the Arduino Mega.
6. Use the serial monitor in Arduino IDE to send commands to the DaisyBot.
7. Wiring Diagram

## Schematics & Wiring 

## Troubleshooting
If you experience issues during installation or operation, try the following:

- Ensure that your wiring matches the diagram and the code.
- Check that your code is correctly representing your hardware circuit.
- Double-check your connections and components.
